# Portfolio
## Description
This project provides a place to display current and future profesional accomplishments. My motivation for this project was to create a portfolio that can evolve over time. With as much experience and knowledge I gain, the portfolio can follow suit. Throughout working on this project I learned the value of Flex Boxes and the abilities they have to truly shape the layout of a webpage.
